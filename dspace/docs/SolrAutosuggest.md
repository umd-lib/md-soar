# Solr Autosuggest

## Introduction

This page describes the Solr autosuggest functionality for MD-SOAR.

## Background

This functionality is implemented as a "ChoiceAuthority" plugin based on the
stock DSpace authority control functionality. See
<https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSPACE/Authority+Control+of+Metadata+Values>
for more information.

This implementation only performs "choice management", i.e., it generates a
list of possible choices. It does *not* implement "authority control", as no
authority key is provided with the chosen value.

The suggestions are provided by the Solr "suggester" functionality. See
<https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_11/suggester.html> for more information.

## Behavior

Provides suggestions for the "Format" (dc.genre) and "Subject Keywords"
(dc.subject) fields on the submissions form from the "search" Solr core, based
on the text typed in the fields by the user.

Both the "Format" and "Subject Keywords" fields are "open", in that the user
may type in any value (i.e., is not required to choose one of the suggested
values).

## Configuration

### Solr configuration

The Solr "search" core is configured with two "suggester" search components in
the `dspace/solr/search/conf/solrconfig.xml` file.

The "formatSuggest" suggester looks up entries in the "dc.genre" field, while
the "subjectSuggest" suggester looks up entries in the "dc.subject" field. Both
suggesters use the "BlendedInfixLookupFactory" as the lookup implementation
as it seems to give the best results (compared to the
"AnalyzingInfixLookupFactory" used in DSpace 6 MD-SOAR which seemed to give
duplicate suggestions).

A "suggest" request handler is also added to the Solr "search" core for use in
retrieving suggestions. This can be tested directly using `curl`. For example,
to search the "formatSuggest" suggester (i.e., the "dc.genre" field) for entries
with "book":

```zsh
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/search/suggest?indent=true&q.op=OR&suggest.dictionary=formatSuggest&suggest.q=book&wt=json&highlight=false'
```

**Note:** If applying this configuration to an existing Solr "search" core, a
Solr reindex is necessary for suggestions to actually be generated.

### DSpace configuration

Two files require configuration for this functionality:

* `dspace/modules/additions/src/main/resources/spring/spring-dspace-addon-umd-custom-services.xml`
* `dspace/config/local.cfg`

The `spring-dspace-addon-umd-custom-services.xml` file uses Spring to configure
the "edu.umd.lib.dspace.content.authority.SuggestService" interface with the
"edu.umd.lib.dspace.content.authority.SolrSuggestService" implementation.

The `local.cfg` configures the autosuggest functionality for use
with the "Format" and "Subject Keywords" submission form fields. The
`dspace/config/local.cfg.EXAMPLE` contains the appropriate configuration:

```text
# Configuration settings for Solr autosuggest
solr.suggest.server=${solr.server}/${solr.multicorePrefix}search

# "Format" submission form field
choices.plugin.dc.genre = SolrFormatAuthority
choices.presentation.dc.genre = suggest
choices.SolrFormatAuthority.dictionary = formatSuggest

# "Subject Keywords" submission form field
choices.plugin.dc.subject = SolrSubjectAuthority
choices.presentation.dc.subject = suggest
choices.SolrSubjectAuthority.dictionary = subjectSuggest
```

The `solr.suggest.server` property is used to define the Solr server and core
to use for the suggestion lookups. The same Solr server (and core) is used for
both suggestion lookups.

The `choices.plugin.<SCHEMA.ELEMENT>` and
`choices.presentation.<SCHEMA.ELEMENT>` properties are used to configure the
form submission field to use the autosuggest functionality. See
<https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSPACE/Authority+Control+of+Metadata+Values>.

The `choices.<AUTHORITY>.dictionary` properties are used by the
"SolrSuggestService" class to configure the Solr suggester to use for
each field.

The DSpace suggestion endpoint can be tested directly using `curl`. For example,
to search the "formatSuggest" suggester (i.e., the "dc.genre" field) for entries
with "book":

```zsh
$ curl 'http://localhost:8080/server/api/submission/vocabularies/SolrFormatAuthority/entries?filter=book&exact=false'
```
